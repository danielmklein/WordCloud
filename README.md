Project Description:
This project is in under the direction of Dr. Joseph Smith, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Alabama. 
We aim to build a piece of software, written in Python, that will perform automated content analysis on a collection of legal documents 
and create a statistical word cloud illustrating the terms that characterize the collection. 
We are approaching the research objective with a highly object-oriented design that can be built incrementally. 

Final delivery of the software is scheduled for early December 2013. 
The GitHub repository for the project is viewable at https://github.com/dmarklein/WordCloud.
