    Given 1+ SuperDoc objects (and perhaps analysis parameters TBD), this class
    will perform natural language text processing on the collection of 
    documents and return a weighted list of the "most important" terms in the
    collection. This will likely utilize term frequency-inverse document
    frequency analysis as its basis for weighting terms 
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).
